![Colino Demo](demo/demo.gif)

Reclaim your attention from algorithmic feeds. Build a personal knowledge garden with high-quality content that serves your goals, not engagement metrics.

Colino is a privacy-first tool that helps you consume information intentionally. It gathers content from RSS feeds, articles, and YouTube videos, then makes it available to your AI assistant for deep analysis and understanding.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Privacy-First**: Everything stays local on your device. No accounts, no tracking, no cloud services.
- **Curated Sources**: Choose exactly what content enters your knowledge base.
- **AI Integration**: Analyze and summarize your content using your preferred AI assistant.
- **Automated Ingestion**: Set it up once and let Colino keep your library current.
