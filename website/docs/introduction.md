# Introduction

## The Attention Economy's Cost

Every day, algorithmic feeds compete for your attention with carefully crafted notifications, infinite scrolls, and attention-grabbing headlines. These systems are designed to keep you engaged, not informed. The result? Information overload, reduced focus, and a growing sense that you're consuming more but understanding less.

Research shows this constant exposure to curated feeds can have negative psychological effects, increasing anxiety while decreasing our ability to focus on what truly matters [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590291125005212).

## A Different Approach: Intentional Information

Colino is built on a simple philosophy: **you should control what information enters your mind**. Instead of algorithmic feeds that maximize engagement, Colino helps you create a personal knowledge garden that serves your goals and curiosity.

### What is Colino?

Colino is your personal gateway to intentional information consumption. It quietly works in the background, gathering content from sources you choose and making it available to your AI assistant for deep analysis and understanding.

**How it works:**
- **Curate Your Sources**: Add RSS feeds from high-quality publications, research journals, or trusted voices
- **Automatic Ingestion**: Colino fetches articles, extracts readable content, and grabs YouTube transcripts when relevant
- **Local Storage**: Everything lives on your device in a private database—no accounts, no tracking, no cloud services
- **AI Integration**: Connect with your preferred LLM through Model Context Protocol to query, summarize, and analyze your content

### The Philosophy Behind Colino

**Privacy as Freedom**: Your reading habits, interests, and thoughts are your own. Colino never sends your data to external services or uses it for advertising.

**Quality Over Quantity**: By carefully selecting your sources and using AI to process content, you focus on understanding rather than consumption.

**Sustainable Knowledge**: Build a personal library that grows more valuable over time, accessible whenever you need it through natural language queries.

### Who is Colino For?

- **Researchers** who need to stay current in their field without drowning in noise
- **Lifelong Learners** building expertise in specific domains
- **Professionals** who need industry insights without social media distractions
- **Anyone** looking to reclaim their attention from algorithmic feeds

Colino isn't another content aggregator—it's a tool for mindful information consumption in an age of distraction.
