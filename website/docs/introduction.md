# Introduction

## What is Colino?
Colino is a command-line tool that helps you stay informed by aggregating and summarizing content from multiple sources, including RSS feeds and YouTube channels. It uses AI to provide concise summaries, so you can quickly catch up on the latest news without information overload.

Colino is privacy-first: all data stays on your device, and there’s no user tracking. It’s open source, so you can inspect, modify, and contribute to the code. You control the AI prompts and the data.

## Why?
Social media and news sites rely heavily on images, videos, and distractions. This keeps you engaged longer, but often wastes your time and can have negative psychological effects [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590291125005212).

The solution is to be intentional about the information you consume and use tools that help you filter out noise. Colino is one of those tools.
